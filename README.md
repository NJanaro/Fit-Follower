  **Fit Finder** is a clone of **Strava**, a workout tracking app that allows you to share your workout stats with other as well as compare and compete with other users. Unlike Strava, this app uses a Rails backend with a React frontend and PostgreSQL database to provide a fast and responsive single page design. Google maps API is implemented to handle the mapping of routes for users. Some of the features that are implemented in this clone are:

* Built from scratch **User authentification** using BCrypt password digests and unique session token cookies for easy authorized site navigation.
* Bespoke **users dashboard** with snapshots of workout stats and a **feed of followed users** recent workouts
* Dedicated **routes page** to quickly see all routes that belong to a user
  * a seperate show page to view and/or edit a specific route
* Dedicated **workouts page** to quickly see all workouts acomplished by a user
  * a seperate show page to view and/or edit a specific workout
* Forms to **input new routes and workouts** that includes the option to **assosiate workouts with routes**
